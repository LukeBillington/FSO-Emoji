# FSO Tools
**UPDATED FOR FSO 4.1.** Recently Full Sail constructed a new LMS v4 to make keeping track of assignments easier.
I had issues with the new interface in regards to it's usability leading me to create this Chrome extension.

**Screenshots can be seen further below.**

## What it does
+ **Separates modules from activities.** Groups and colors assignments under modules and adds spacing between modules.
+ **Highlights today's assignments.** All assignments marked as due today will be highlighted.
+ **Adds a dark mode.** Toggle this by pressing the FSO Tools icon next to the address bar.

## How to update

Otherwise, if you haven't installed FSO Tools before, see the How to install section below.

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Remove the old version of this extension off of your machine.
3. Replace the new version in the same location as the old version was previously.
4. In Chrome, visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
5. Refresh the page, make sure you see that the current version number – next to the FSO Tools title – reads 1.1 instead of 1.0.

If you are unable to update FSO Tools with these steps, remove the extension from the page and then load it in again like steps 5 and 6 below.

## Troubleshooting & support
I am providing this extension as-is without support with no guarantee it will work as intended for all users, but in hopes to help
those wanting an improved FSO experience.

I may update this plugin if I find any changes necessary, if you find any glaring issues or things missing, please contact me or file an issue.

This version was designed for the student version of FSO. As I am aware the date highlights and module grouping should work on the faculty side,
but I'm certain there may be issues with the dark mode experience.

Also, I am in no way affiliated with the creation of FSO, and this is not intended to be a bash on it either. Just a happy Full Sail Student.

Enjoy.
