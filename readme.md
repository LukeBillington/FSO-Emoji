# FSO Emoji
Recently I was seeing in my school's program chat that someone would be interested in Emoji icons in place of grades.
This is a very simple Chrome extension to just that. It's not intended to be the most efficient as far as code goes, but it works.

**PLEASE NOTE: This extension is not yet compatible with my FSO Tools extension and is designed for students in bachelor's degree programs only.**

**Screenshot can be seen further below.**

## How to install
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Move the FSO Emoji folder to a safe location on your computer.
3. In Chrome, visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
4. At the top, enable the developer mode checkbox.
5. Below, choose the load unpacked extension option.
6. Navigate to the FSO Emoji folder and select.
7. Open FSO in Chrome to see the applied changes.

## Troubleshooting & support
I am providing this extension as-is without support with no guarantee it will work as intended for all users, but in hopes to help those wanting an improved FSO experience.

I may update this plugin if I find any changes necessary, if you find any glaring issues or things missing, please contact me or file an issue.

This version was designed for the student version of FSO.

Also, I am in no way affiliated with the creation of FSO, and this is not intended to be a bash on it either. Just a happy Full Sail Student.

Enjoy.
